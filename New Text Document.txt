1. if available memory is more than 1GB(1024MB) then echo something
Ans.
#!/bin/bash

mem=`free -m|grep Mem|awk '{print $7}'`
if [ $mem -gt 1024 ]
then
        echo available memory is greater than 1GB
else
        echo available memory is less than 1GB
fi

2. Find out the available memory and if it is more than 40% then echo something
Ans.
#!/bin/bash

mem=`free -m|grep Mem|awk '{print $7}'`
echo Available memory is $mem
y=`expr $mem \* 100 / 1024`
if [ $y -gt 40 ]
then
        echo available memory is greater than 40 percent
else
        echo available memory is less than 40 percent
fi

3. In df -h / ,find out the available storage, convert into MB and if it is more than 1GB then echo something
Ans.
#!/bin/bash

mem=`df -h /|grep dev|awk '{print $4}'|sed 's/[M,G]//g'`
c=`df -h /|grep dev|awk '{print $4}'|sed 's/[0-9,.]//g'`
#Conversion of GB/MB into MB
if [ $c = G ]
then
        mb=`echo $mem \* 1024|bc|awk -F '.' '{print $1}'`
else
        mb=$mem
fi

echo -e "Available memory is $mb \bMB"

if [ $mb -gt 1024 ]
then
        echo Available memory is greater than 1GB
else
        echo Available memory is less than 1GB
fi

4. Same as before but in %, find out the available storage,convert it and if it is more than 1GB then echo something
5. I have shell script, only root should be able to run it(use whoami command)
