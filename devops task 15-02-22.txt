1.How to make file system mount permanently?
Ans.
*ext4: The ext4 or fourth extended filesystem is a widely-used journaling file system for Linux.
**step-1: you need to properly format the new volume(partition) with the ext4 file system type using the mkfs.ext4 or mke4fs command as follows: # mkfs.ext4 /dev/diskname(Ex: # mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdg)
**step-2: Make directory using command- # mkdir /dir_name(Ex: # mkdir /dsk2)
**step-3: Mount using command- # mount /dev/diskname /dir_name(Ex: # mount /dev/xvdg /dsk2)
**step-4: Find UUID(Universally Unique Identifier) of new volume using command- # blkid /dev/diskname(Ex:  # blkid /dev/xvdg)
**step-5: open 'fstab' file using command- # vi /etc/fstab
**step-6: Add 'UUID=paste_uuid   /dir_name    ext4   defaults  0   0'(Ex: UUID=d55ae35a-df8e-4243-9f3f-1c7711f6a432     /dsk3       ext4   defaults  0  0) at the end of file
